               >C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> nevertheless long has been due a thorough
            re-examination. The last general book-length treatment of the poem, <a

               title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Schwab
               1972</a>, was published in Italian more than thirty years ago; the standard study of

               title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Dobbie
               1937</a>, is almost seventy years old. Both works naturally have been superseded in
            part by subsequent discoveries and changing critical interest. While the poem has
            remained a central text in several of our most significant debates (e.g. <a

               1992</a>), scholars have in recent years missed the contextualisation only an
            up-to-date re-examination of the poem in its various textual, cultural, and literary
            aspects can provide.</p>

            longer-standing, problem for students of the poem has been the lack of an adequate
            critical text. The most frequently cited edition, <a
               href="../backmatter/bibliography.htm#DOBBIE1942"
               title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Dobbie
               1942</a>, is fundamentally flawed. It divides the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span>
            into ostensibly parallel &#x201C;Northumbrian&#x201D; and &#x201C;West-Saxon&#x201D;
            versions despite convincing evidence, presented in <a
               href="../backmatter/bibliography.htm#DOBBIE1937"
               title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Dobbie
               1937</a> and never seriously questioned, to suggest that dialect played a relatively
            minor role in the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span>&#x2019;s recensional development; in
            doing so it also confuses accidental and significant recensional variants, and presents
            readers with an implicit view of the poem&#x2019;s textual history that is both
            unsupported by any surviving evidence and contradicted by Dobbie&#x2019;s own earlier
            work. Although the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span>&#x2019;s general textual development
            and transmission has been the subject of several significant studies over the last
            half-century (e.g. <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.htm#CAVILL2002"

            comprehensive, multi-recension, critical text. With the exception of Dobbie, all editors
            of the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span> concentrated on individual witnesses or

                  >C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span>: a multimedia edition and archive</span>
            addresses these problems by offering readers a broad literary, historical, and textual
            study of <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span>, a complete archive of
            all known witnesses to the poem, and an edition containing critical texts of the <span
               class="titlem">Hymn</span> at significant points in its presumed textual history,
            including the written archetype presumed to underlie all surviving recensions of the
               <span class="titlem">Hymn</span>. As such the book updates and, where necessary,
            re-evaluates and replaces previous standard work on the poem. The introductory study is
            based on a thorough re-examination of the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span>&#x2019;s
            textual, cultural, literary, and linguistic evidence. Given the variety of ways in which
            the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span> has been discussed in the secondary literature and
            the importance of the poem in several key areas of enquiry in Anglo-Saxon studies, this
            re-examination of necessity has ranged widely: <span class="titlem"
               >C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> is as interesting to students of the reception of
            Old English poetry as it is to palaeographers; it is as useful a source of information
            about the history of the Northumbrian dialect as it is about the adoption of traditional
            Germanic formulae and diction by early vernacular Christian poets; it is as significant
            as a possible &#x201C;case history&#x201D; of a vernacular singer as it is as evidence
            for Bede&#x2019;s possible adaptation of an archetypal myth of poetic inspiration. While
            I cannot claim to have covered all areas of <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s
               Hymn</span> research<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker" name="ref_CHI.NOTE.0010"

            edition present the texts in what I hope will prove to be a useful format. <span
               class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> is at the same time too complex to
            represent editorially through a single critical edition and too stable and consistently
            transmitted to avoid drawing conclusions about its probable original state and the
            relationships among its various recensions. <span class="titlem"><span class="titlem"
                  >C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span>: a multimedia edition and archive</span>,
            therefore, offers readers critical texts of the poem at all major points in its textual
            transmission: editions of the five major recensions, a critical reconstruction of the
            archetype as this is implied by the surviving witnesses, and two &#x201C;scribal
            performances&#x201D; of manuscripts that have become increasingly important in debates
            about the poem&#x2019;s transmission. The rationale for these editorial decisions are
            discussed in detail in the editorial introduction (<a href="../introduction/ch7.htm"
               title="Link to chapter 7: Editorial introductions (separate document).">Chapter 7:
               Editorial introductions</a>). The textual archive contains transcriptions, new colour
            facsimiles (where possible), and semi-diplomatic editions of all evidence used in the
            construction of these editions. With two exceptions, these transcriptions and editions
            are based on my personal examination of the manuscripts in question.</p>

            prove a useful addition to Anglo-Saxon studies, <span class="titlem"><span

               archive</span> is also an experiment in contemporary publishing. Distributed in a
            hybrid print-and-digital form, the book attempts to harness the particular strengths of
            the two media to produce a work that is more useful than either of its parts. The print
            text is designed for browsing and ready reference. It contains a complete text of the
            introductory study, basic editions of the main recensions, diplomatic transcriptions of
            all known witnesses, a list of references, index, and glossary. It is the version most
            users likely will consult first: to check a reference, discover the date of an
            individual witness, or cite from a particular recension or manuscript of the poem. The
            electronic text on the accompanying CD-ROM is designed to take advantage of the superior
            interactivity and storage capabilities of the digital medium. This version contains a
            complete text of the print edition. Intended for more detailed research, however, the
            CD-ROM also offers readers features impossible or prohibitively expensive to reproduce
            in print form. Manuscripts of the hymn are represented by high-quality digital
            facsimiles, in most cases full colour, and, where possible, with options for examining
            the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span> as a detail or in the context of the entire page
            upon which it is found. Critical editions and witness transcriptions can be manipulated
            interactively to display different types of information. Witness transcriptions can be
            viewed in diplomatic or semi-diplomatic (i.e. with modern lineation and word division)
            form; in some cases it is also possible to compare pre- and post-correction versions of
            the same text. The electronic critical editions offer users much greater flexibility in
            the presentation of textual variants: readers can adjust the apparatus to show various
            types of variation (e.g. &#x201C;significant,&#x201D; &#x201C;substantive,&#x201D; and
            &#x201C;orthographic&#x201D;), to display the readings of all manuscript witnesses to a
            given form, or to produce parallel text editions of the all known copies of a specific
            recension or the poem as a whole. Links within the apparatus readings, the introduction,
            index, glossary, and witness transcriptions allow users to navigate quickly from
            individual forms to parallel texts, definitions, or relevant sections of the
            introductory study. Colour is used liberally throughout to help users identify key
            relationships among manuscripts, recensions, and other relevant textual data.</p>

            began my study of <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> as part of my
            dissertation research under Professor Fred C. Robinson of Yale University. I began work
            on this edition in earnest soon after taking up my position at the University of
            Lethbridge in 1997. I am grateful to both Professor Robinson and the current and former
            deans of the Faculty of Arts and Science at the University of Lethbridge, Baghwan Dua
            and Chris Nicol, for their interest and patience with this project. I am also grateful
            to the University of Lethbridge, Faculty of Arts and Science, and the Curriculum
            Redevelopment Centre of the University of Lethbridge for their financial and in-kind
            help in completing this work.</p>

                  &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>I first proposed writing an electronic
            edition of <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> to the editorial
            board of SEENET in the fall of 1997. I am grateful to Hoyt N. Duggan and the board for
            their interest in and support of this project from my initial proposal for a small SGML
            edition to its final manifestation as a much larger, print-and-CD-ROM hybrid. I am
            especially thankful to the editorial board and anonymous readers at SEENET and the
            Medieval Academy for their suggestions for improvements. Needless to say all errors
            remain my own responsibility.</p>

            from numerous friends and colleagues. Information Services at the University of
            Lethbridge library has shown dedication far beyond the call of duty in tracking down
            literally hundreds of articles and books for me in libraries around the globe. I am
            particularly grateful to Rosemary Howard and Marina Crow who bore the brunt of my often
            very obscure requests. Inge Genee, Philip Rusche, and Shelley Stigter read and commented
            on the entire text of this edition in draft and saved me from numerous small and large
            errors. Dr. Rusche is also responsible for suggesting that I consider publishing in this
            multi-media format. My colleagues in the Department of English at the University of
            Lethbridge have dutifully shown up year after year for colloquium presentations on the
            finer points of electronic editing and manuscript transmission; I am grateful for their
            interest in this work, even if I suspect they may be glad to see the back of
            C&#x00E6;dmon and his nine-line hymn. I have also had the great fortune to have the
            support of my colleagues on the executive board of the Digital Medievalist Project, and
            fellow members of the mailing-lists Ansax-l, Medtext-l, Humanist-l, and Tei-l, all of
            whom have been very gracious with their time and advice in solving research problems.
            Manuscript librarians in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, and Russia, have been
            helpful without exception in providing me with both access to the manuscripts and high
            quality digital facsimiles. Manuscript images on the CD-ROM are reproduced with

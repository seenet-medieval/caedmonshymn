                  &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>According to Bede, C&#x00E6;dmon was an old
            lay herdsman in the religious community of <span class="term" lang="ANG"
               >Strean&#x00E6;shalch</span> (Whitby Abbey).<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker"

                  >[</span>1<span class="hideme">]</span></a> Although the singing of vernacular
            songs was a customary entertainment at the abbey, C&#x00E6;dmon himself never learned to
            sing, and, as a result, used to leave feasts before he could be called upon to do so.
            Having left such a gathering one night and returned to his stables, C&#x00E6;dmon fell
            asleep, whereupon he was addressed in his dream by &#x201C;someone&#x201D; (Bede uses
            the Latin indefinite pronoun <span class="quote" lang="LAT">quidam</span>), who asks him
            to sing for him. Explaining that he cannot, and, indeed, that he has just left the feast
            for that reason, C&#x00E6;dmon at first refuses. When the visitor insists, however, he
            gives in. Asking for a subject, he is told, <span class="quote" lang="LAT">Canta...
               principium creaturarum</span>, &#x201C;Sing... about the beginning of created
            things.&#x201D; Almost immediately he begins his famous <span class="titlem"
            >Hymn</span>, which Bede paraphrases in Latin for the benefit of his readers:</p>
         <blockquote lang="LAT">
            <p>Nunc laudare debemus auctorem regni caelestis, potentiam Creatoris et consilium
               illius, facta Patris gloriae: quomodo ille, cum sit aeternus Deus, omnium miraculorum
               auctor extitit, qui primo filiis hominum caelum pro culmine tecti, dehinc terram
               Custos humani generis omnipotens creauit.</p>
         </blockquote>
         <blockquote>
            <p>Now we must praise the Maker of the heavenly kingdom, the power of the Creator and
               his counsel, the deeds of the Father of glory and how He, since he is the eternal
               God, was the Author of all marvels and first created the heavens as a roof for the
               children of men and then, the almighty Guardian of the human race, created the
               earth.</p>

            everything that happened to him. He adds additional verses to his song and reports his
            vision and his new skill to his steward. Brought to the abbess, C&#x00E6;dmon describes
            his dream and sings his <span class="titlem">Hymn</span>. He is then assigned a sacred
            text to translate into verse overnight by way of a test. When he proves himself able to
            do so, he is ordered to join the religious community.</p>

            discovered that C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s gift extends to all holy subjects: upon hearing a
            passage of church history or doctrine, Bede tells us, C&#x00E6;dmon is able after a
            brief period to turn his lessons into <span class="quote" lang="LAT">carmen
               dulcissimum</span>, &#x201C;most melodious verse.&#x201D; In addition to the <span
               class="titlem">Hymn</span>, his works are said to include poems on a wide range of
            subjects: the creation of the world, the beginnings of mankind, the biblical Genesis,
            the flight from Egypt and entry into the promised land, the incarnation, passion,
            resurrection, and ascension of the Lord, the coming of the Holy Spirit, the teachings of
            the apostles, the terrors of hell, joys of heaven, and an account of God&#x2019;s gifts
            to mankind.</p>

                  &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>The last part of Bede&#x2019;s account
            concerns C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s exemplary life in the abbey, and, as Kiernan has pointed
            out, is less congenial to modern tastes (<a

               title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Kiernan
               1990a</a>, 158). Bede reports that C&#x00E6;dmon was humble and obedient to the
            monastic rule and extremely zealous in his work against those who were not. After an
            illness of fourteen days, he is said to die like a saint: able to predict the hour of
            his own death, C&#x00E6;dmon asks to be moved to the hospice in which the terminally ill
            are lodged even though his own condition seems anything but serious. He gathers his
            friends and servants around him and asks if they have any outstanding quarrels with him.
            Told that they do not, he prays briefly, asks for the Blessed Sacrament, and finally
            expires just before <span class="foreign" lang="LAT">nocturn</span>.</p>

                  &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>Bede&#x2019;s account of the poet
            C&#x00E6;dmon is one of the most famous passages in Anglo-Saxon literary studies.
            Indeed, it is probably one of the few bits of Anglo-Saxon literary history known to
            anybody other than professional Anglo-Saxon scholars. The <span class="titlem"
               >Hymn</span> commonly is anthologised in undergraduate textbooks, where it is
            accompanied invariably by some version of Bede&#x2019;s chapter as headword or footnote,
            often as an introduction to further discussion of Anglo-Saxon prosody, compositional
            practice, or the adaptation of traditional pagan poetic forms and vocabulary to
            Christian ends (e.g. <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#FERGUSONETAL1996"
               title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Ferguson et
               al. 1996</a>, 1 and n.; <a

                  &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>The story is also of the greatest importance
            to Anglo-Saxonists. Bede&#x2019;s account is one of very few surviving contemporary
            non-fiction references to Anglo-Saxon vernacular poetic composition, performance, and
            reception. It is also by far the most detailed. It is, if it is reliable, an extremely
            important source of information about the way in which early medieval vernacular poetry
            was composed, received, and appreciated. It can be used for assessing the applicability
            to early medieval society of theories of oral composition developed through the
            observation of twentieth-century cultures (e.g. <a
               href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#MAGOUN1955"

            administratively important figures in the Anglo-Saxon church (e.g. <a

            biographical information survives.<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker"

            Bede&#x2019;s account is reliable. And there are some things about it that, at first
            glance at least, do not seem all that promising. Most importantly, of course, there is
            the &#x201C;miracle&#x201D;: modern scholars on the whole do not believe that poets
            learn to compose accomplished verse overnight by the grace of God at the command of
            dream visitors&#x2014;especially poets who appear, according to their biographers at
            least, to have had a complete ignorance of and even distaste for the tradition their
            work adapts.<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker" name="ref_CH1.NOTE.050"

                  >[</span>3<span class="hideme">]</span></a> Then there is the problem of
            C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s training and methods of performance and composition. If scholars
            find it difficult to believe that untrained herdsmen can be turned overnight into
            technically accomplished poets through God&#x2019;s intervention, they have an
            especially difficult time believing in those whose training and careers appear to have
            more in common with monastic exegetes than traditional poets (e.g. <a
               href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#FRITZ1974"

               title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Irvine
               1994</a>, 431-435) or seem to show parallels to other well-known stories of poetic
            inspiration around the world (see <a href="../introduction/ch2.html"
               title="Link to chapter 2: Sources and analogues (separate document).">Chapter 2:
               Sources and analogues</a>, below). Finally, there is the problem of religion. In
            addition to being a historian, Bede was a religious scholar and extremely pious man. It
            is possible that his praise for C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s poetry&#x2014;indeed, his account
            of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s life in general&#x2014;was conditioned as much by his
            enthusiasm for the poet&#x2019;s cause as any real respect for his art (e.g. <a
               href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#IRVINE1994"
               title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Irvine

               title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Hunter Blair
               1985</a>, 24-25). If Bede&#x2019;s chapter on C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s life and work is
            to represent anything other than a lost opportunity at recovering a near contemporary
            account of the production and consumption of vernacular Anglo-Saxon poetry, we need to
            learn to read it in a way that allows us to recover its historical truth without
            offending either our own reason or Bede&#x2019;s understanding of the events he is
            recording (see most recently <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#ROWLEY2003"

                  &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>Fortunately, this is not an impossible task,
            although it does require us to learn more about Bede&#x2019;s intentions in recording
            the C&#x00E6;dmon story and the intellectual framework within which he was working. For
            Bede&#x2019;s account is primarily an interpretative performance: it is less important
            for what it tells us about the technical details of how C&#x00E6;dmon came by his gift
            or composed his poetry than it is for what it tells us about how this apparently
            important Anglo-Saxon vernacular poet was understood by at least one intellectually
            significant Anglo-Saxon. Bede appears, for the most part, to have believed the details
            of his story as it is reported in the <span class="titlem">Historia
            ecclesiastica</span>. But he was not an eyewitness and does not suggest that he had the
            story from some specific, particularly knowledgeable informant. At times, indeed, he
            even appears to be uneasy with the implications of certain details of the story as it
            was told to him. What Bede is sure of, however, is his subject&#x2019;s significance and
            place in vernacular literary history: we are being told the C&#x00E6;dmon story because
            Bede considered C&#x00E6;dmon to be a great poet whose religious vernacular verse was
            without compare and who had a strong effect on those who heard it. Although it reports
            on an apparent miracle of God&#x2019;s grace and appears in a work of ecclesiastical
            history, the form and content of Bede&#x2019;s chapter in fact align it far more closely
            with the modern genre of literary biography. It is, indeed, the first of our <span

                  &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>Given modern interest in the mechanics of
            C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s inspiration, perhaps the most surprising thing about
            Bede&#x2019;s chapter is the extent to which it is not about the &#x201C;miracle&#x201D;
            that made C&#x00E6;dmon a poet. The real story in IV. 24 is not <em>how</em>
            C&#x00E6;dmon learned to sing as much as it is how <em>well</em> he learned to do so and
            how this ability affected his life and the lives of those lucky enough to hear him.
            C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s actual dream occupies a relatively insignificant structural
            position in the story as a whole. As Abrahams has noted, the chapter is centred around
            the moment C&#x00E6;dmon joins the religious community at Strean&#x00E6;shalch after the
            performance of his second song: the sentence in which the abbess instructs him to become
            a monk straddles the story&#x2019;s geometric centre (<a

            life, moreover, the dream vision also occupies a correspondingly small portion of
            Bede&#x2019;s biography. While modern r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9;s tend to concentrate on the
            exchange with the dream visitor and compress or even ignore everything after the account
            of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s training and career, Bede himself devotes fewer words to
            C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s actual dream (196 words or 22% of the total) than to the
            description of his life in the monastery and death (318 words or 35%) or his interview,
            training, and career (222 words or 25%).<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker"

            of secular song, and quality of verse, but not the specific means by which the poet came
            by his gift, is, at 162 words, just under 83% as long as Bede&#x2019;s account of the

            characters. When C&#x00E6;dmon is brought before the abbess and her counsellors, he is
            asked about his vision but tested on his compositional abilities. Although the examiners
            listen to his song and agree that his experience must represent a gift from God, they do
            not ask him to join their community until he proves himself able, in an act mimicking
            rather than directly testing his original experience, to compose a second poem on a
            subject of his human examiners&#x2019; choosing:</p>

            propagandist, likewise, is never attributed to audience knowledge of either the origins
            of his gift or his wondrous first composition. Although Bede tells us twice that
            C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s verse is able to turn men&#x2019;s hearts to despise the world,
            the context in which this claim is made on both occasions makes it clear that Bede
            considers this success to be a result of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s superb skill as a poet
            rather than the influence of his vision or unique quality of his first song. The first
            time Bede refers to C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s effect on the hearts of men, his claim is
            preceded by a reference to the songs he composed in response to the religious
            instruction he received from Hild&#x2019;s counsellors after his vision:</p>

                  &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>On the night of Hild&#x2019;s death at
            Strean&#x00E6;shalch, two nuns in the sister abbeys of Strean&#x00E6;shalch and Hackness
            see a vision of their abbess&#x2019;s soul being taken to heaven in the company of
            angels. At Strean&#x00E6;shalch, the vision was seen by an unnamed though particularly
            devoted nun in a distant part of the monastery who roused her companions to prayer long
            before the other nuns at the abbey were informed of the abbess&#x2019;s demise. At
            Hackness, the vision was seen by Begu, a nun of &#x201C;thirty or more&#x201D;
            years&#x2019; service, who similarly led her sisters in vigil until word of
            Hild&#x2019;s demise arrived from Strean&#x00E6;shalch. When the time of Hild&#x2019;s
            death was compared to that at which the nuns at Hackness saw their vision, it was
            discovered that the two events coincided exactly, a beautiful coincidence, Bede tells
            us, by which <span class="quote" lang="LAT">procuratum est diuinitus ut, cum illi exitum
               eius de hac uita uiderent, tunc isti introitum eius in perpetuam animarum uitam
               cognoscerent</span>, &#x201C;it was divinely ordained that while some of them watched
            her [i.e. Hild&#x2019;s] departure from this life, others watched her entrance into the
            everlasting life of the spirit.&#x201D;</p>

                  &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>According to Bede, Imma was a young retainer
            of King &#x00C6;lfwine. In the battle of Trent, at which &#x00C6;lfwine was killed, Imma
            was wounded and ultimately captured by allies of his lord&#x2019;s enemy, King
            &#x00C6;&#x00F0;elred. Lying about his noble status for fear of his life, Imma was taken
            prisoner, and, after he recovered from his wounds, shackled. At this point, however, a
            miracle occurred. For no matter how many times his jailers tried to bind him, these
            bonds came undone whenever they left the room. Impressed by this wonder and discovering
            his true noble status, &#x00C6;&#x00F0;elred&#x2019;s henchmen decide to sell their
            prisoner to a Frisian trader. Once again, however, the thane proves impossible to bind
            and Imma is allowed to go home to raise an appropriate ransom. Discussing events with
            his brother Tunna after his release, Imma discovers why he could not be shackled: Tunna,
            who was a priest, had thought that Imma had been killed at the battle of Trent and had,
            as a result, said masses every morning for the release of his brother&#x2019;s soul from
            purgatory. When the times of the masses are compared with the times at which
            Imma&#x2019;s bonds had come undone, it becomes clear that the masses had been
            responsible for loosening his shackles: by praying for the release of his
            brother&#x2019;s soul from purgatory, Tunna was able to free Imma from his temporal
            bonds. Imma goes on to tell many others about his experience and these men were
            inspired, in Bede&#x2019;s words,</p>

            stories and Bede&#x2019;s account of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s life and career are clear
            enough. In the case of the vision of Hild&#x2019;s soul, the most important elements
            include the characters&#x2019; insignificant administrative status, their association
            with Hild&#x2019;s monasteries, and the fact that they have a vision. In the case of
            Imma, the similarities include the indirect way in which Bede associates his
            character&#x2019;s story with the death of a historically more significant figure in the
            history of the English church, and the claim that Imma, like C&#x00E6;dmon, enjoyed
            considerable success as a Christian propagandist after his miraculous experience.</p>

                  &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>These superficial similarities, however,
            belie much more significant differences. While the nuns who watch Hild&#x2019;s soul
            ascend to heaven are like C&#x00E6;dmon in that they are administrative
            non-entities&#x2014;Bede tells us the name and years service (but nothing else) of one
            and leaves the other nameless&#x2014;they are unlike C&#x00E6;dmon in that their vision
            is intimately connected with Saint Hild. While the two nuns are presented as being
            themselves holy women, nothing in Bede&#x2019;s account suggests that this wonder could
            have happened only to them. Far more significant than their identities are the locations
            in which they experience their visions (far enough away from Hild&#x2019;s deathbed to
            prevent them from having immediate knowledge of the abbess&#x2019;s death, but close
            enough to receive word of it the next morning) and the fact that it was Hild&#x2019;s
            soul they saw ascending to heaven. The real miracle in this story is Hild&#x2019;s: any
            two pious individuals who happened to look up into the sky in the vicinity of Whitby
            Abbey at the appropriate time that night presumably would have served God&#x2019;s plan
            equally well.</p>

                  &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s story, however, has
            much less of an essential connection to Hild or even Whitby Abbey. Bede implies that
            C&#x00E6;dmon had his vision at Strean&#x00E6;shalch during Hild&#x2019;s administration
            and that it was Hild and her counsellors who questioned him and ultimately invited him
            to join their community.<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker" name="ref_CH1.NOTE.105"

            C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s. There is no intrinsic reason, apart from the fact that
            C&#x00E6;dmon already lived in Whitby, why he could not have received the gift of song
            at any other monastery or under any other abbess. Bede does not mention Hild or even
            Strean&#x00E6;shalch by name in the chapter, and, while the poet&#x2019;s career is
            often held by modern scholars to represent one of the highlights of her abbacy (e.g. <a

               al. 2001</a>, &#x201C;Hild&#x201D;), C&#x00E6;dmon does not receive a mention in
            Bede&#x2019;s earlier account of Whitby under Hild&#x2019;s stewardship in IV. 23.</p>

            bonds and C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s <span class="titlem">Hymn</span>, the principal
            difference between the two stories lies in the nature of the main characters&#x2019;
            miracles and the way in which, in his chapter on Imma, Bede attempts to tie his
            character&#x2019;s experiences into the main narrative of the <span class="titlem"
               >Historia ecclesiastica</span>.<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker"

                  >[</span>7<span class="hideme">]</span></a> In C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s story, as we
            have seen, the actual wonder of the poet&#x2019;s inspiration and initial performance
            plays a relatively minor role in the events of the chapter as a whole. Bede refers to
            the dream only as it occurs in the story&#x2019;s narrative and he attributes little or
            none of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s later success as a propagandist to direct audience
            knowledge of his dream vision or initial song. Imma&#x2019;s story, on the other hand,
            is far more <em>about</em> the main character&#x2019;s miracle: Imma is released from
            his bonds on more than one occasion and a considerable amount of narrative space is
            devoted to speculation as to why he cannot be shackled. Just as importantly, Bede
            himself is much more explicit in accounting for the significance of the wonder he
            relates. He begins the chapter on Imma by stating that he believes the account
            &#x201C;should certainly not be passed over in silence, since the story may lead to the
            salvation of many&#x201D; (<span class="quote" lang="LAT">nequaquam silentio
               praetereundum arbitror, sed multorum saluti, si referatur, fore proficuum</span>).
            Destroying the suspense inherent in his narrative, moreover, he goes on to tell us twice
            about the miracle&#x2019;s significance as a demonstration of the efficacy of the mass
            even before Imma returns to his brother and discovers the real cause of his freedom:
            first in his own voice, noting that no one could bind Imma <span class="quote"
               lang="LAT">quarum celebratione</span>, &#x201C;on account of the celebration of these
            [masses],&#x201D; and subsequently, when Imma is questioned by his first captor, in that
            of the captive himself, who immediately and correctly guesses the solution to the
            puzzle:</p>
         <blockquote lang="LAT">
            <p>&#x201C;Sed habeo fratrem&#x201D; inquit &#x201C;presbyterum in mea prouincia, et
               scio quia ille me interfectum putans pro me missas crebras facit; et si nunc in alia
               uita essem, ibi anima mea per intercessiones eius solueretur a poenis.&#x201D;</p>
         </blockquote>
         <blockquote>
            <p>&#x201C;However,&#x201D; said he, &#x201C;I have a brother in my country who is a
               priest and I know he believes me to be dead and offers frequent masses on my behalf;
               so if I had now been in another world, my soul would have been loosed from its
               punishment by his intercessions.&#x201D;</p>

                  &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>To make sure the point is not lost,
            moreover, Bede concludes the narrative section of the chapter with one more explicit
            discussion of what has happened and why it is important: when Imma returns and compares
            stories with his brother he discovers not only that he was correct about the
            correspondence between the release of his bonds and his brother&#x2019;s masses, but
            also that <span class="quote" lang="LAT">alia, quae periclitanti ei commoda contigissent

            chapter&#x2019;s end, finally, Bede returns to his rationale for including the story in

            unusual for the relative lack of attention it pays to the apparent wonder by which the
            poet came by his gift, it is just as unusual for the amount of space it devotes to
            describing the rest of his life, career, and oeuvre. IV. 24 is an instalment in the
            literary history of Anglo-Saxon England, rather than, primarily at least, the history of
            the establishment of the English church. The two histories are related in as much as
            C&#x00E6;dmon is a religious poet and his story takes place at Hild&#x2019;s abbey. But
            Bede&#x2019;s preference for the biographical, literary, and aesthetic details of
            C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s oeuvre over the sacramental or institutional implications of his
            vision ensures that the chapter remains generically distinct.<a

            modern scholars of Anglo-Saxon literature what they most lack from the period: an
            approximately contemporary account of literary life in Anglo-Saxon England written by
            somebody who, if we are to believe the claims of his student Cuthbert (see below,
               &#x00A7;&#x00A0;<a href="#CH1.230"
               title="Link to associated location in this document.">1.24</a>), was himself well
            trained in the vernacular poetic tradition. No comparable non-fiction account of
            Anglo-Saxon literary life survives from the entire period.</p>

                  &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>Indeed, it is hard to overestimate how
            unusual Bede&#x2019;s account is as a literary document. From a vernacular tradition
            spanning nearly half a millennium, literary history records the names of no more than a
            dozen Old English poets: &#x00C6;duwen, Aldhelm, Alfred, Anlaf, Baldulf, Bede,
            C&#x00E6;dmon, Cnut, Cynewulf, Dunstan, Hereward, and Wulfstan (or perhaps Wulfsige).<a

                  >[</span>9<span class="hideme">]</span></a> Of these, most are almost certainly
            spurious. Later English writers, particularly those of the twelfth century, seem to have
            developed quite a taste for discovering the names of traditional Anglo-Saxon poets (see

            they actually composed vernacular verse is a bit stronger. A few Old English poems
            contain internal clues to the identity of their authors. The most famous of these, of
            course, are the four texts from the Exeter and Vercelli Books that preserve
            Cynewulf&#x2019;s runic &#x201C;signature.&#x201D; A fifth internal attribution may be
            found in a metrical runic inscription on a small brooch found on Ely, in which a certain
            &#x00C6;duwen is identified as the ornament&#x2019;s owner in a way that suggests she
            also might have composed the inscription.<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker"

            about these poets other than their names and the identity of their signed works. A sixth
            example is a verse preface to the Old English translation of <span class="titlem"
               >Gregory&#x2019;s Dialogues</span> preserved in <span class="shelfmarklabel">British
               Library, Cotton Otho C. i</span>, in which Wulfstan is identified as the bishop
            responsible for commissioning the volume as a whole and it is suggested that he may have
            been responsible for the composition of the preface itself (<a

               1953</a>, 225-231). Unfortunately, however, this last attribution is certainly
            incorrect: Wulfstan&#x2019;s name is written over an erasure (<a

            entire Anglo-Saxon period for whom we know something specific about their work and
            biography: King Alfred, to whom the metrical translation of Boethius&#x2019;s <span
               class="titlem">Metres</span> is attributed in two prefatory texts; Saint Bede, to
            whom the Old English poem <span class="titlem">Bede&#x2019;s Death Song</span> may be
            attributed in a letter describing his last days; and the herdsman C&#x00E6;dmon. In the
            case of the first two, these attributions should come as no surprise. Bede and Alfred
            were prominent Anglo-Saxons, well known to their own and subsequent generations for both
            their literary significance and their accomplishments in other fields, and not shy about
            discussing their own literary endeavours<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker"

            we might expect to attract attention from later biographers and historians. The real
            surprise, indeed, is how few and, in the case of Bede at least, how hesitantly the
            surviving attributions are made. Despite Alfred&#x2019;s well-documented and life-long
            interest in vernacular poetry, no composition apart from the <span class="titlem"
               >Metres</span> is attributed to him in contemporary sources.<a

         <p class="noindent">As Opland notes, however, it is not entirely clear that Cuthbert is
            attributing this text to Bede: most manuscripts of the letter do not use a finite verb
            to describe Bede&#x2019;s presentation of the song, and the theme was relatively common
            in Old English and Anglo-Latin literature. The fact that Cuthbert&#x2019;s description
            places the performance of the Old English poem in the context of a series of quoted
            passages from sacred scripture, indeed, might be taken as evidence simply that Bede also
            cited analogous vernacular texts (see <a
               href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#OPLAND1980"
               title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Opland
               1980</a>, 140-141). On the other hand, the inclusion of the Old English text of the
            poem in Cuthbert&#x2019;s Latin letter, the observation that Bede &#x201C;was learned in
            our song,&#x201D; and the fact that Bede composed a Latin poem on the same subject all
            seem to suggest that his connection to the vernacular poem was stronger than mere
            quotation. By citing the poem directly, Cuthbert seems to be implying that its specific
            wording was in some way important, either as a vernacular poem endorsed by a scholar who
            generally appears to have frowned upon secular entertainment (see <a

            the paucity of the surviving records. But Bede&#x2019;s account of
            C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s inspiration is exceptional not only for its length and detail. It
            is also set apart by the nature of its subject. For C&#x00E6;dmon, unlike Alfred and
            Bede, is known primarily because he could sing. No trace of the herdsman&#x2019;s story

            information about the life, work, and reception of an approximately contemporary poet,
            Bede also provides us with an account of an unparalleled type of poet: one whose claim
            to our attention lies almost exclusively in his skill at composition and his significant
            position (in his biographer&#x2019;s opinion) in vernacular literary history.</p>

            to suggest that this essentially literary interest in C&#x00E6;dmon was deliberate. For

            inspiration is not the primary focus of Bede&#x2019;s chapter, so too is it possible to
            show that the artistry and impact of his poetry is. In order to see this, however, it is
            first necessary to consider just how unusual a life C&#x00E6;dmon led. For C&#x00E6;dmon
            was privileged to experience not one but two potential miracles in the course of his
            life: the first, as we have seen, was his gift of poetic inspiration. The second, as
            Wieland points out, was his apparent foreknowledge of impending death (<a

            we find no reference to it, or its potentially saintly implications, at the beginning of
            Bede&#x2019;s chapter. Instead of describing C&#x00E6;dmon as a saintly man who learned
            how to compose wonderful songs, became a zealous monk, and foresaw the end of his life,
            Bede instead describes him as a great singer who was a good and pious
            man&#x2014;ignoring entirely his apparently saintly end and concentrating exclusively on
            the beauty of his poetry, his position as the premier vernacular religious poet of his
            day, and his success as a religious propagandist:</p>

            <p>In the monastery of this abbess there was a certain brother who was specially marked
               out by the grace of God, so that he used to compose godly and religious songs; thus,
               whatever he learned from the holy Scriptures by means of interpreters, he quickly
               turned into extremely delightful and moving poetry, in English, which was his own
               tongue. By his songs the minds of many were often inspired to despise the world and
               to long for the heavenly life. It is true that after him other Englishmen attempted
               to compose religious poems, but none could compare with him. For he did not learn the
               art of poetry from men nor through a man but he received the gift of song freely by
               the grace of God. Hence he could never compose any foolish or trivial poem but only
               those which were concerned with devotion and so were fitting for his devout tongue to
               utter. He had lived in the secular habit until he was well advanced in years and had
               never learned any songs.</p>

         <p class="noindent">While there is much in the actual details of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s
            life that could be understood as suggesting that he was much more than a good poet and
            pious monk, Bede does not exploit this aspect of his material: he downplays the
            importance of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s vision in describing his success as a propagandist,
            and he largely ignores the evidence of saintliness implicit in his final foreknowledge
            of death. For Bede, C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s primary significance was as a poet, not as a
            saint: the origins of his gift and the holiness of his life were all secondary to the
            beauty and power of his verse.</p>

            more or less reliable as a source of factual information about how Anglo-Saxon poets
            worked or were received. Modern readers still find it difficult to accept that a poet
            can learn to compose traditional verse overnight at the command of a dream visitor and
            Bede&#x2019;s account, even if it is unusual for the <span class="titlem">Historia

            art over the wonder of his inspiration, nevertheless still appears in a work of church
            history written by a prominent religious scholar and historian: we would hardly expect
            to find him including a chapter on the life and work of the <span class="titlem"
               >Beowulf</span> or <span class="titlem">Deor</span> poets after all, and it is
            difficult to forget that Bede would have had a doctrinal stake in promoting the work of
            the Whitby herdsman. His praise for C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s poetry, his depiction of the
            reactions of the abbess and her counsellors, even his presentation of C&#x00E6;dmon as a
            poet taught not by men but by the grace of God may all have been influenced, consciously
            or unconsciously, as much or more by his support for C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s goals as by
            any real knowledge of how the poet learned to sing, his subsequent methods of
            composition, the extent of his oeuvre, or perhaps even the real aesthetic quality of his
            verse. Given the generally low opinion of the poem held by modern scholars,<a

            Bede&#x2019;s account represents simply wishful thinking&#x2014;an attempt to claim that
            C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s poetry is as good, as important, and as unusual as Bede wished it
            were. Even if Bede set out on this one occasion to write what best can be described as
            an ancestor to the literary biography, his account may be so ideologically,
            historically, and theologically bound as to prevent us from learning very much from him

            scourged him for being more Ciceronian than Christian in his literary taste&#x2014;Bede

            practice of Moses and Daniel and can serve as a model for those who are able to use

               ordinary speech. The grammarians use the Greek term &#x201C;schema&#x201D; for this
               practice, whereas we correctly label it a &#x201C;manner,&#x201D;
               &#x201C;form,&#x201D; or &#x201C;figure,&#x201D; because through it speech is in some
               way clothed or adorned.... The Greeks pride themselves on having invented these
               figures or tropes. But, my beloved child, in order that you and all who wish to read
               this work may know that Holy Writ surpasses all other writings not merely in
               authority because it is divine, or in usefulness because it leads to eternal life,
               but also for its age and artistic composition, I have chosen to demonstrate by means
               of examples collected from Holy Writ that teachers of secular eloquence in any age
               have not been able to furnish us with any of these figures and tropes which did not
               appear first in Holy Writ.</p>

            Bede&#x2019;s treatment of C&#x00E6;dmon as a poet untouched by native tradition.
            Although, as we shall see below (<a href="../introduction/ch3.html"
               title="Link to chapter 3: C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn and Germanic convention (separate document)."

               convention</a>), <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> is, formally
            speaking, a profoundly Germanic poem, Bede&#x2019;s discussion of the poet&#x2019;s
            methods of performance and composition establish the herdsman poet as what we might
            describe as an &#x201C;anti-guslar&#x201D;: a poet whose training, performance, and
            career is contrasted at almost every point with those of the presumably traditional and
            secular singers he abandons at the <span class="foreign" lang="LAT">conuiuium</span>.
            The opening lines of Bede&#x2019;s chapter establish both that C&#x00E6;dmon had never
            learned any songs before his dream vision and that he could not sing songs of pure
            entertainment even after his encounter with his dream visitor. C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s
            subsequent career, likewise, is implicitly contrasted with that of traditional singers
            at almost every stage (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#FRANTZEN1990"
               title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Frantzen
               1990</a>, 139-144; <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#KLEINER1988"
               title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Kleiner
               1988</a>). While modern scholarship in oral and traditional verse performance
            suggests that poets learn their craft while young men by listening to more experienced
            and accomplished singers (see <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#LORD2000"
               title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Lord
               2000</a>), C&#x00E6;dmon is said to have been an old man who habitually left
            festivities when singing began in order to avoid being called upon to perform. For
            C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s fellows, the singing of songs is a pleasant social event: they
            perform inside on joyful occasions, accompanied by the harp, and take turns singing to
            an audience made up of their peers. For C&#x00E6;dmon, however, poetry is a solitary
            obligation: he receives his inspiration outside after he leaves the hall in which his
            colleagues are feasting; he is commanded to sing by an apparently otherworldly visitor
            who neither accepts his first refusal nor asks for a song after first singing something
            himself; and he performs without instrumental accompaniment to an audience consisting
            solely of his interlocutor and, presumably, the animals he was watching over that night.
            C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s training, moreover, as Fritz and others have pointed out,
            resembles not so much that accorded a traditional vernacular poet as a monk destined to
            become a scriptural exegete (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#FRITZ1974"

            tradition, C&#x00E6;dmon is instead taught scripture, patristics, and church history, a
            training which, as Fritz and Day have demonstrated, produces a corpus of verse almost
            exactly in keeping with that prescribed by Augustine for religious scholars and Latin
            poets (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#FRITZ1969"

            1975</a>, 54-55). In suggesting that C&#x00E6;dmon was a better poet than his
            contemporaries, Bede emphasises the differences between his and their careers, training,
            methods of composition, and performance. Given his interest in demonstrating the
            superiority of Christian literature over its pagan counterpart, it is entirely possible
            that Bede in this case allows his desire to influence the details of the story he
            tells.</p>

                  &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>Taken together, this evidence suggests that
            Bede was more interested in C&#x00E6;dmon as a poet of the English language than as a
            saint of the English church, and that he had a strong interest in demonstrating the
            superiority and independence of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s verse from previous vernacular
            tradition. But proving that Bede had a partisan interest in promoting
            C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s uniqueness, artistic skill, and value as a propagandist is not
            the same thing as demonstrating that he made up or consciously distorted his evidence
            for C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s reputation, quality, or methods of composition. Bede was a
            pious man who believed that God could directly intervene in the affairs of men. His
            predilection for C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s poetry, though ideologically convenient, is also
            perfectly in keeping with the taste for religious orthodoxy demonstrated in his own
            Latin poetry, and, even if he did not actually compose it, his performance of the <span
               class="titlem">Death Song</span> from his death bed. The fact that it was handy for
            Bede to believe that C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s poetry was of such exceptional quality does
            not mean that he actually considered the Whitby herdsman to be a poor poet, or thought
            that Hild and her scholars did not set C&#x00E6;dmon to composing the rest of his now
            lost body of religious verse. Certainly the rest of the Anglo-Saxon poetic corpus, in
            which pagan works are essentially absent and even secular poems dealing with religious
            themes such as <span class="titlem">Beowulf</span> are outnumbered by explicitly pious
            texts like <span class="titlem">Soul and Body</span>, <span class="titlem"
               >Phoenix</span>, and <span class="titlem">Prayer</span>, suggests that more than one
            Anglo-Saxon agreed with Bede in his estimation as to what made for good Old English
            verse.</p>

            &#x201C;miracle&#x201D; of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s inspiration. Bede believed in
            miracles, but had a different understanding of what a miracle was. Where we tend to see
            miracles as being a technical explanation of last resort, as a means of explaining
            events that cannot be accounted for in any non-supernatural way, Bede saw them as a way
            of explaining why things happen, whether or not their causes can be explained on
            non-supernatural grounds (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#WARD1976"

            disciples on islands (examples are collected and discussed in <a

               1994</a>, 25-43). Even phenomena that Bede in his scientific writing is able to
            attribute to natural rather than divine causes assume a divine tincture in the <span
               class="titlem">Historia ecclesiastica</span> when their occurrence warrants the
            interpretation that they are part of God&#x2019;s plan. For Bede, calling something a
            miracle is an act of interpretation, not an attempt at explanation.</p>

                  &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>Moreover Bede does not always assume a
            miracle is at work, even when he describes phenomena for which no rational explanation

            history that, to our eyes at least, simply cannot be true. Bede&#x2019;s depiction of
            the British Isles in I. 1, for example, contains the following famous description of
            Ireland:</p>
         <blockquote lang="LAT">

               hiemem aut faena secet aestate aut stabula fabricet iumentis; nullum ibi reptile
               uideri soleat, nullus uiuere serpens ualeat. Nam saepe illo de Brittania adlati
               serpentes, mox ut proximante terris nauigio odore aeris illius adtacti fuerint,
               intereunt; quin potius omnia pene quae de eadem insula sunt contra uenenum ualent.
               Denique uidimus, quibusdam a serpente percussis, rasa folia codicum qui de Hibernia
               fuerant, et ipsam rasuram aquae inmissam ac potui datam talibus protinus totam uim

         <blockquote>
            <p>Ireland is broader than Britain, is healthier and has a much milder climate, so that
               snow rarely lasts there for more than three days. Hay is never cut in summer for
               winter use nor are stables built for their beasts. No reptile is found there nor
               could a serpent survive; for although serpents have often been brought from Britain,
               as soon as the ship approaches land they are affected by the scent of the air and
               quickly perish. In fact almost everything that the island produces is efficacious
               against poison. For instance we have seen how, in the case of people suffering from
               snake-bite, the leaves of manuscripts from Ireland were scraped, and the scrapings
               put in water and given to the sufferer to drink. These scrapings at once absorbed the
               whole violence of the spreading poison and assuaged the swelling.</p>

            this happen himself and doesn&#x2019;t claim that it is a miracle. Bede seems to have
            thought that the ability to cure snake-bites was an inherent property of medieval Irish
            manuscripts rather than a demonstration of any particular saint&#x2019;s sanctity or
            evidence of God&#x2019;s direct intervention in the affairs of men.</p>

            C&#x00E6;dmon because it suggests that the &#x201C;fact&#x201D; that the herdsman
            learned to sing overnight in a way that we on the whole consider to be impossible does
            not necessarily mean that Bede himself considered the poet&#x2019;s inspiration to be a
            miracle or that Bede was consciously adapting C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s story to emphasise
            its wondrous aspects. Although his account leaves open the possibility that the Whitby
            herdsman&#x2019;s career and death were the result of one or more miracles, Bede never
            argues that they actually were. His chapter&#x2019;s opening lines indicate that he
            believed that C&#x00E6;dmon was taught to sing by the grace of God rather than through
            the agency of men. But Bede never claims in the course of his narrative that the visitor
            who told C&#x00E6;dmon to sing actually was an angel. In his description of the dream,
            Bede refers to the visitor, as we have seen, noncommittally using the indefinite Latin

            would attempt to explain C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s experience in this fashion. Bede
            believed in supernatural events&#x2014;even supernatural events he did not consider to
            be miraculous&#x2014;in a way that most modern scholars do not. But this does not mean
            that he accepted everything he was told about C&#x00E6;dmon or shared none of our doubts
            about the poet&#x2019;s life and death. That Bede was uncertain about the precise nature
            of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s experience, indeed, is suggested by the reluctant way he
            treats C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s apparent foreknowledge of his impending death (see above,
               &#x00A7;&#x00A0;<a href="#CH1.250"
               title="Link to associated location in this document.">1.26</a>). Just how surprising
            this reluctance is can be best seen by comparing Bede&#x2019;s unemphatic conclusion to
            the C&#x00E6;dmon story to Cuthbert&#x2019;s far more assertive claims about
            Bede&#x2019;s own last hours. Bede, after recording that C&#x00E6;dmon asked to be
            removed to the hospice despite his apparent lack of serious illness and timed his
            departure so that it coincided with <span class="foreign" lang="LAT">nocturn</span>,
            concludes his account by noting that <span class="quote" lang="LAT">qui etiam praescius
               sui obitus extitisse ex his quae narrauimus uidetur</span>, &#x201C;and from what has
            been said, it would seem that he [i.e. C&#x00E6;dmon] had foreknowledge of his
            death.&#x201D; In contrast, Cuthbert&#x2019;s account of Bede&#x2019;s demise asserts
            that Bede foresaw the time of his death despite an explicit statement to the contrary
            from Bede himself. When Bede, quoting Elihu (<span class="titlem">Job</span> 32:22),
            tells his disciples to concentrate because he does not know how long he will be with
            them (<span class="quote" lang="LAT">nescio quamdiu subsistam, et si post modicum tollat
               me Factor meus</span>, &#x201C;I know not how long I may be with you, nor whether
            after a short time my Maker may not take me from you&#x201D;),<a

                  >[</span>22<span class="hideme">]</span></a> Cuthbert interrupts the narrative to
            assert that Bede nevertheless really did seem to have foreknowledge of the hour at which
            he was to die: <span class="quote" lang="LAT">Nobis tamen uidebatur, ne forte exitum
               suum bene sciret</span>, &#x201C;[b]ut it seemed to us that he knew very well when
            his end should be.&#x201D; Elsewhere in Bede&#x2019;s <span class="titlem"
               >Historia</span>, the veracity of saints&#x2019; foreknowledge of death is also more
            vigorously asserted. Thus the death of Chad in IV. 3 is foretold first of all in
            elaborate detail by the saint himself, and then immediately endorsed by the
            narrator&#x2019;s own conclusion that <span class="quote" lang="LAT">Quod quidem ita ut
               dictum ei erat opere completum est</span>, &#x201C;[t]his was fulfilled just as he
            had been told....&#x201D; Likewise, the veracity of Wilfred&#x2019;s warning that he
            should die four years after his vision of the archangel Michael at Meaux is accepted
            without comment in Bede&#x2019;s account of the saint&#x2019;s death in V. 19.</p>

                  &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>It is this apparent hesitation at describing
            C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s inspiration and death as miracles that argues for Bede&#x2019;s
            belief in the facts of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s story&#x2014;or at least the facts as he
            thought he knew them. Bede clearly believed that C&#x00E6;dmon had learned to sing
            overnight in a dream in response to the commands of an unknown interlocutor. He also
            seems to have thought that C&#x00E6;dmon composed great poetry and that he might have
            foreseen the hour of his own death. The trouble Bede appears to have had with the story
            lies not in its &#x201C;facts&#x201D; but in what these facts meant: that is, in
            deciding whether or not these to our minds unlikely incidents indicate that
            C&#x00E6;dmon was a saint or had been in direct contact with God or his angels. For us,
            the question is whether or not we accept the premises of the story as Bede appears to
            have learned and believed it. If we do, then the question of how this inspiration
            occurred is something we can only answer by seeking explanatory parallels or
            rationalisations: perhaps C&#x00E6;dmon really had learned more songs than Bede was
            aware of (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#MORLAND1992"
               title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Morland
               1992</a>); perhaps he had some blockage that prevented him from singing (<a

                  >[</span>23<span class="hideme">]</span></a> If, as seems more likely, however, we
            do not accept that C&#x00E6;dmon really learned to sing overnight, then there is nothing
            more to be learned about C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s oeuvre or methods of composition from
            Bede&#x2019;s account. Bede provides us with no evidence to suggest that he knew a more
            &#x201C;rational&#x201D; explanation for C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s poetic ability, and, in
            as much as he does not claim to have been an eyewitness to C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s career
            or inspiration, there is no point attempting to sift his account for clues as to what
            &#x201C;really&#x201D; went on (cf. <a
               href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#PALGRAVE1831"

               title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Morland
               1992</a>). What we can say is that Bede was impressed by C&#x00E6;dmon and by the one
            piece of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s poetry that we can be sure he knew. We can also say that
            all evidence suggests that Bede is reporting the story of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s
            inspiration, career, and death as it had been told to him. If we believe the facts of
            the story must have been otherwise, our quarrel is not with Bede but with those who
            first embellished the tale he passes on. Unfortunately, we will never know what those
            people really knew of C&#x00E6;dmon or, if they changed his story, why they decided to
            do so. Regardless of the historical truth of Bede&#x2019;s story, the account remains an
            important source of interpretative information about how C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s song was
            understood by the period&#x2019;s most significant scholar.</p>

               long before the rest of the argument, although it was subsequently revised. It
               devotes approximately 35% (205 words) of its length to C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s dream,
               33% (194 words) to the poet&#x2019;s interview, training, and career, and 18% (132
               words) to the discussion of the poet&#x2019;s life and death in the monastery. In
               this summary, C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s admission to the religious community comes
               approximately 56% of the way through the narrative (he is ordered to
               &#x201C;join&#x201D; at the 328th word). Kiernan devotes 136 words or 41% of his 334
               word summary to C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s dream, 59 words or 18% to the poet&#x2019;s
               training and subsequent career, and 84 words or 24% to his subsequent life in the

               summary of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s training and oeuvre, although he otherwise follows
               the proportions of the Latin text it translates relatively closely.</p>

            <p>In the Old English translation of Bede, the dream is even less prominent than in
               Bede&#x2019;s original Latin. At 216 words in <a

                  title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Miller
                  1890-1898</a>, it is only 17% of the chapter, 57% as long as the 377 word
               description of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s training and oeuvre, and much less than half
               the length of the account of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s life as a monk and saintly death
               (474 words or 37% of the 1286 word chapter). It also allows C&#x00E6;dmon to take his
               monastic vows slightly early: in the Old English version, C&#x00E6;dmon agrees to
               become a monk by the 593rd word (46% of the way through).</p>

            <p>It is possible to debate these figures: C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s interview with the
               abbess and her counsellors, for example, is at least in part concerned with the dream
               vision in that they ask him <span class="quote" lang="LAT">indicare somnium et dicere

               which he spoke&#x201D; before setting him his new commission. Even if one considers
               the initial interview with the abbess and subsequent tests to be part of
               Bede&#x2019;s account of the dream-vision, the story of the actual wonder ends up
               occupying no more space than the account of his life in the monastery and saintly
               death (i.e. 288 words or approximately 1/3 of the chapter&#x2019;s total length). For

               he existed, began his career in Whitby during Hild&#x2019;s abbacy (i.e. sometime
               between 657 and 680) and died sometime between 679 and 684 (for modern discussion of

                  paraphrase</a>). Bede&#x2019;s chapter begins by placing C&#x00E6;dmon <span
                  class="quote" lang="LAT">In huius monasterio abbatissae</span>, &#x201C;In the
               monastery of this abbess,&#x201D; a clear reference to Hild, the ascension of whose
               soul is described in the last paragraph of the preceding chapter, and
               Strean&#x00E6;shalch, the abbey in which Hild is said to have died. That his
               inspiration occurred during Hild&#x2019;s administration, moreover, is suggested by
               Bede&#x2019;s description of the morning after C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s vision, in
               which C&#x00E6;dmon is taken by his reeve <span class="quote" lang="LAT">ad
                  abbatissam</span>, &#x201C;to the abbess,&#x201D; a reference almost certainly to
               Hild in as much as no indication of a change in abbess has been suggested since the
               chapter&#x2019;s opening lines.</p>

            <p>The date of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s death is slightly more uncertain. The first line
               of the chapter following Bede&#x2019;s description of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s death
               (IV. 25) suggests that the fire at Coldingham Abbey happened <span class="quote"
                  lang="LAT">his temporibus</span>, &#x201C;about this time.&#x201D; While the E
               text of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle dates this fire to 679, Bede appears to have
               thought it happened sometime after the death of the Abbess &#x00C6;bba, who was still
               alive in 681 (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#PLUMMER1969"

                  [1896] 1969</a> 2: 258). The next specific date given in the <span class="titlem"
                  >Historia ecclesiastica</span> comes at the beginning of IV. 26, where Bede dates
               Ecgfrith&#x2019;s raid on Ireland <span class="quote" lang="LAT">Anno dominicae
                  incarnationis DCLXXXIIII</span>, &#x201C;In the year of our Lord 684&#x201D;.
               Taken together, these suggest an early obit of 679 (the E Chronicle dating of the
               Coldingham fire), and a late date of 684 (the next certainly datable event in
               Bede&#x2019;s history).</p>

               that the C&#x00E6;dmon and Imma episodes show an essential similarity in their
               portrayal of the appropriation of a Germanic pagan (and oral) past by a Christian
               (and largely literary) present (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#LERER1991"
                  title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Lerer
                  1991</a>, chapter 1). The two stories differ, however, in that Bede appears to see
               C&#x00E6;dmon as being far more revolutionary. As Lerer demonstrates, Imma&#x2019;s
               story is largely about the replacement of pagan magic with a functional Christian
               equivalent: the story shows that the sacrifice of the mass can release temporal and
               spiritual bonds at least as effectively as pagan charms. In C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s
               story, on the other hand, Bede depicts the creation of an entirely new type of poetry
               by an entirely new type of poet. As discussed below (&#x00A7;&#x00A0;<a
                  href="#CH1.320" title="Link to associated location in this document.">1.33</a>),
               Bede contrasts C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s oeuvre, methods of composition, performance,
               and training with that of the secular poets of the <span class="foreign" lang="LAT"
                  >conuiuium</span> at every possible juncture. Unlike Aldhelm, moreover, who is
               said by William of Malmesbury to have disguised himself as a (secular) minstrel in
               order to lure his parishioners back to church (see below, &#x00A7;&#x00A7;&#x00A0;<a

               understood as recounting the establishment of a school of religious vernacular verse,
               does in fact involve an essential episode of the establishment of the church, since
               such verse would presumably serve as an important tool in the instruction and
               conversion of illiterate Anglo-Saxons (see in particular <a

               few authentic accounts of the reception of vernacular verse for us to know much about
               how it was used), Bede makes no such claim for C&#x00E6;dmon in the <span

               him.&#x201D; Furthermore, while Bede does show how C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s verse
               helped turn the minds of his audiences to divine concerns, he never suggests the poet
               had any more than a local effect: he makes no claim that men&#x2019;s hearts still
               are turned to God through the performance of C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s songs, and he

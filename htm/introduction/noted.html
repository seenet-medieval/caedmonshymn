&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span><span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> has served as a test case for several studies of scribal performance in the transmission of Old English poetry (e.g <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#CAVILL2000" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Cavill 2000</a>; <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#ORTON1998" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Orton 1998</a>; <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#ODONNELL1996A" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">O&#x2019;Donnell 1996a</a>; <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#OKEEFFE1990" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">O&#x2019;Keeffe 1990</a>; <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#KIERNAN1996" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Kiernan 1996</a>; <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#JABBOUR1968" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Jabbour 1968</a>).<a class="footnoteinsertionmarker" name="ref_NOTED.NOTE.280" id="ref_NOTED.NOTE.280" href="#note_NOTED.NOTE.280" title="Link to associated note at the end of this document."><span class="hideme">[</span>1<span class="hideme">]</span></a> Two studies in particular, <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#JABBOUR1968" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">Jabbour 1968</a> and <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#OKEEFFE1990" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">O&#x2019;Keeffe 1990</a>, cite differences among witnesses and recensions of the poem to demonstrate the influence of non-literate methods of transmission on Anglo-Saxon scribal practice. In the case of Jabbour, whose work is heavily influenced by the study of English ballads (see 38-45), this method involves the memorisation of the texts in question. In the case of O&#x2019;Keeffe, whose approach attempts to discover and define the nature of a transitional stage in the development of Anglo-Saxon literacy between its presumed oral and literate phases, the method involves the adaptation of improvisational techniques associated with oral formulaic theory to the transmission of a written text (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#OKEEFFE1990" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">O&#x2019;Keeffe 1990</a>, 46; also 191-193). Both studies take the presence of sensible, metrical, and formulaically appropriate variation in a written poetic tradition as key evidence for the operation of their proposed methods; perhaps not surprisingly, both draw their principal examples in the case of <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> from witnesses to the <a href="../edition/eorthan/index.html" title="Link to critical text of the WS eor&#x00F0;an recension (separate document)." class="eorthan">West-Saxon <span class="term">eor&#x00F0;an</span> recension</a>: <a href="../transcription/b1/index.html" title="Link to transcription and facsimile of eorthan (separate document)."><span class="eorthanlabel" title="Witness of the WS eorthan recension.">B1</span></a> in the case of Jabbour, and (in practice) <a href="../transcription/b1/index.html" title="Link to transcription and facsimile of eorthan (separate document)."><span class="eorthanlabel" title="Witness of the WS eorthan recension.">B1</span></a> and <a href="../transcription/o/index.html" title="Link to transcription and facsimile of eorthan (separate document)."><span class="eorthanlabel" title="Witness of the WS eorthan recension.">O</span></a> in that of O&#x2019;Keeffe.</p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>Neither study is very convincing, at least as far as it pertains to <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span>. In Jabbour&#x2019;s case, the suggestion that the thoroughgoing textual variation that separates <a href="../transcription/b1/index.html" title="Link to transcription and facsimile of eorthan (separate document)."><span class="eorthanlabel" title="Witness of the WS eorthan recension.">B1</span></a> from the other members of <a href="../edition/eorthan/index.html" title="Link to critical text of the WS eor&#x00F0;an recension (separate document)." class="eorthan"><span class="term">eor&#x00F0;an</span></a> tradition fits the expected pattern for memorial transmission of verse (see esp. 200) fails to take into account the context in which the witness is found: as a part of the Old English translation of Bede&#x2019;s <span class="titlem">Historia ecclesiastica</span>, the <a href="../transcription/b1/index.html" title="Link to transcription and facsimile of eorthan (separate document)."><span class="eorthanlabel" title="Witness of the WS eorthan recension.">B1</span></a> text of <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span> was copied as an integral part of the manuscript&#x2019;s much longer (and presumably not memorially-transmitted) main prose text. As we have seen above (&#x00A7;&#x00A7;&#x00A0;<a href="../introduction/ch7.html#CH7.630" title="Link to referenced passage in chapter 7: Editorial introductions (separate document).">7.61</a>-<a href="../introduction/ch7.html#CH7.640" title="Link to referenced passage in chapter 7: Editorial introductions (separate document).">7.62</a>), this prose text is itself highly innovative, and shows types and amounts of textual variation similar to those found in the vernacular poem. While the variation may not be inconsistent with memorial transmission, the context in which the poem is found suggests that the actual cause more probably lies in coordinated editorial activity by the scribes of the manuscript&#x2019;s main text or, since the innovations appear to be spread evenly across both scribes&#x2019; work, perhaps by the scribe or scribes of an earlier exemplar.</p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>O&#x2019;Keeffe&#x2019;s suggestion that manuscripts of the <a href="../edition/eorthan/index.html" title="Link to critical text of the WS eor&#x00F0;an recension (separate document)." class="eorthan">West-Saxon <span class="term">eor&#x00F0;an</span> recension</a> as a whole show evidence of &#x201C;transitional literacy&#x201D; founders on a similar difficulty. In O&#x2019;Keeffe&#x2019;s view, scribes working at a transitional point in the development of Anglo-Saxon literacy are characterised by their ability to introduce metrically, formulaically, syntactically, and semantically appropriate substitutions spontaneously into the texts they copy (<a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#OKEEFFE1990" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">O&#x2019;Keeffe 1990</a>, 40). In the case of <span class="titlem">C&#x00E6;dmon&#x2019;s Hymn</span>, the evidence that this &#x201C;mode of reading&#x201D; is in operation is said to lie in the &#x201C;integral presence&#x201D; (41) of such formulaically appropriate textual variation across witnesses to the <a href="../edition/eorthan/index.html" title="Link to critical text of the WS eor&#x00F0;an recension (separate document)." class="eorthan">West-Saxon <span class="term">eor&#x00F0;an</span> recension</a> (40-41):</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>When we examine the variations in the five tenth- and eleventh-century records of the West Saxon version, we see in the despair of the textual editor palpable evidence of a fluid transmission of the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span> somewhere between the formula-defined process which is an oral poem and the graph-bound object which is a text. We see a reading activity reflected in these scribal variants which is formula-dependent, in that the variants observe metrical and alliterative constraints, and which is context-defined, in that the variants produced arise within a field of possibilities generated within a context of expectations.... These five records of Caedmon&#x2019;s <span class="titlem">Hymn</span> give evidence of a reading activity characterized by intense reader inference, where the reader uses knowledge of the conventions of the verse to &#x201C;predict&#x201D; what is on the page....</p>
 
<p>[T]he variants in Caedmon&#x2019;s <span class="titlem">Hymn</span> use memory not to import a set phrase, but to draw on a formulaic possibility. Reception here, conditioned by formulaic conventions, produces variants which are metrically, syntactically and semantically appropriate. In such a process, reading and copying have actually become conflated with composing.</p>

&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;</span></span>Just as significantly, the scribes responsible for the two eleventh-century manuscripts which do show the most contextually appropriate substantive variation introduce their variation into the text of the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span> in very different ways and in ways consistent with their performance in the larger prose text of which the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span> is a part in both manuscripts. In the case of <span class="eorthanlabel" title="Witness of the WS eorthan recension.">B1</span>, as we have seen above (&#x00A7;&#x00A0;<a href="../introduction/ch7.html#CH7.630" title="Link to referenced passage in chapter 7: Editorial introductions (separate document).">7.61</a>), the type and amount of variation introduced into the text of the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span> are in keeping with that found in the surrounding prose text; while there is nothing to suggest that the variation was not introduced spontaneously&#x2014;except perhaps the suspicious consistency of this variation across the work of two distinct main-text scribes&#x2014;, there is also very little to suggest that this variation was particularly formula-dependent: one of the most striking innovations in this copy of the <span class="titlem">Hymn</span> (<span class="mentioned" lang="ANG"><span class="chword" lang="ANG">&#x01BF;uldorgodes</span></span>) is paralleled nowhere else in the Anglo-Saxon poetic corpus; and while the remaining variants can all be paralleled at least once from Old English verse, all five can also be paralleled from the prose corpus and involve changes similar or identical to those introduced elsewhere by the same scribes in the surrounding prose (for a discussion of this characteristic pattern of scribal variation in &#x201C;fixed context&#x201D; texts, see <a href="../backmatter/bibliography.html#ODONNELL1996A" title="Link to associated location in Bibliography (separate document).">O&#x2019;Donnell 1996a</a>, esp. chapter 3).</p>
